[![Powered by the Spatial Math Toolbox](https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spatialmath-python/raw/master/.github/svg/sm_powered.min.svg)](https://github.com/bdaiinstitute/spatialmath-python)
Much of this repo is a python rewrite of MATLAB code from the Kinegami paper:

Wei-Hsi Chen, Woohyeok Yang, Lucien Peach, Daniel E. Koditschek, and Cynthia R. Sung,
"Kinegami: Algorithmic Design of Compliant Kinematic Chains From Tubular Origami",
IEEE Transaction on Robotics 2022.

We developed this code using python 3.9 and the following libraries:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- roboticstoolbox-python
- ezdxf[draw] (installed as pip3 install ezdxf[draw], see https://ezdxf.mozman.at/docs/setup.html)
