# KinematicTubes
Much of this repo is a python rewrite of MATLAB code from the Kinegami paper:

Wei-Hsi Chen, Woohyeok Yang, Lucien Peach, Daniel E. Koditschek, and Cynthia R. Sung,
"Kinegami: Algorithmic Design of Compliant Kinematic Chains From Tubular Origami",
IEEE Transaction on Robotics 2022.

In addition, we make the following changes and contributions: 
LIST THESE AS I IMPLEMENT THEM


We developed this code using python 3.9 and the following libraries:
numpy
